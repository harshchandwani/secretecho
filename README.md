## User Registration and Account Management

### User Registration

The system supports user registration by allowing new users to create an account. The registration process involves:

- **Collecting User Information:** Users provide essential details such as username, email, and password.
- **Verification:** A verification code is sent to the provided email address to confirm the user's identity.
- **Account Creation:** Upon successful verification, user information is securely stored in the database.

### Updating Unverified User Accounts

For existing but unverified user accounts, the system provides functionality to update the password and verification code. This process includes:

- **Password Update:** Users can set a new password for their account.
- **Verification Code Resend:** A new verification code is generated and sent to the user's email address.
- **Updating Account Information:** Changes are applied to the user account after the new password and verification code have been verified.

This functionality ensures that both new user registrations and updates to existing unverified accounts are managed efficiently and securely.
